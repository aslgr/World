This project implements a simplified life simulator where virtual inhabitants are social and spend their lives moving around different locations, spreading information known as rumors.

## Introduction
A simulation is an experiment with a model that closely mimics reality and its evolution over time.
Discrete Event Simulation (DES) models the operation of a system as a sequence of discrete events in time. The model has a static structure and a dynamic structure:
- The static structure specifies the possible states of the model and is described as a collection of entities and their attributes. The state of the system is the collection of data that describes the system at a given moment.
- The dynamic structure specifies how the state changes over time and is usually defined in terms of events, which occur at a specific moment and change the state of the system.
Between consecutive events, the state of the system does not change, and the simulation can jump directly from the occurrence of one event to the next.
